 Star Topology:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity:** The Star topology is straightforward to set up and manage, making it ideal for small to medium-sized networks. Its centralized structure simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance tasks.
  
2. **Scalability:** It's relatively easy to expand a Star network by adding more devices to the central switch. This scalability makes it suitable for growing networks without significant architectural changes.

3. **Fault Isolation:** If a device fails or encounters issues in a Star network, it typically does not affect the rest of the network. Each device communicates directly with the central switch, minimizing the impact of failures.

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Single Point of Failure:** The central switch in a Star network acts as a single point of failure. If the switch malfunctions or goes offline, it disrupts communication for the entire network, highlighting its vulnerability.

2. **Limited Performance:** As network traffic increases, the central switch may become a bottleneck, affecting overall network performance. The bandwidth available to each device is constrained by the capacity of the switch.

Three-Tier Topology:

**Advantages:**

1. **Scalability:** The Three-Tier topology provides excellent scalability and flexibility, particularly in large enterprise networks. It can accommodate a significant number of devices and support high traffic volumes by distributing network resources effectively.

2. **Redundancy:** By introducing multiple layers of switches, the Three-Tier topology offers built-in redundancy. If one switch or link fails, traffic can be rerouted through alternate paths, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous network operation.

3. **Segmentation:** The Three-Tier topology allows for logical segmentation of network resources into different layers (core, distribution, and access layers). This segmentation enhances network performance, security, and manageability by organizing devices based on their roles and functions.

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Complexity:** Implementing and managing a Three-Tier network can be complex due to the multiple layers of switches and interconnections involved. It requires careful planning, configuration, and maintenance to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

2. **Cost:** The hardware and infrastructure required for a Three-Tier network, including multiple switches and redundant links, can be expensive compared to simpler topologies like the Star. The cost of implementation and ongoing maintenance should be considered when choosing this topology.

In summary, while the Star topology offers simplicity and ease of management, it is susceptible to single points of failure. On the other hand, the Three-Tier topology provides scalability, redundancy, and segmentation benefits but at the expense of increased complexity and cost. The choice between these topologies depends on factors such as the size of the network, performance requirements, budget constraints, and tolerance for complexity.

Create(attached file in assignment submission) a video Explaining the drawbacks of the Star topology using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and illustrate why Star topology is characterized as a single point of failure.

To demonstrate the drawbacks of the Star topology and why it's characterized as having a single point of failure, let's use Cisco Packet Tracer to create a simulated network. In this simulation, we'll set up a basic Star topology with multiple devices connected to a central switch. Then, we'll illustrate how the failure of the central switch can disrupt communication across the entire network.

Step 1: Setting Up the Simulation

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer and create a new blank project.
2. Drag and drop a switch (e.g., Cisco Catalyst 2960) onto the workspace.
3. Connect multiple devices (e.g., computers or laptops) to the switch using Ethernet connections.
4. Configure IP addresses for each device to enable communication within the network.

Step 2: Testing Network Connectivity

1. Power on all devices in the network.
2. Open the command prompt or terminal on each device and test connectivity by pinging other devices within the network. Verify that communication is successful.

Step 3: Simulating Switch Failure

1. Select the central switch in the topology.
2. Right-click on the switch and choose "Delete" or "Power Off" to simulate a switch failure.

 Step 4: Observing the Impact

1. Observe how the network devices react to the switch failure.
2. Attempt to ping devices from each other within the network.
3. Note any connectivity issues or failures in communication.

Step 5: Understanding the Single Point of Failure

1. Analyze the impact of the switch failure on network communication.
2. Since all devices in the Star topology are connected to the central switch, the failure of the switch results in the loss of connectivity for the entire network.
3. This illustrates the concept of a single point of failure in the Star topology, where the central switch acts as a critical component, and its failure can disrupt communication across the entire network.

Step 6: Mitigating Single Points of Failure

1. Discuss strategies for mitigating the single point of failure in a Star topology, such as implementing redundant switches or utilizing higher-grade, more reliable hardware.
2. Implement redundancy by adding a secondary switch and connecting it to the network devices. Configure redundancy protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) to ensure failover in case of switch failure.

Conclusion:

Through this simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer, we've illustrated the drawbacks of the Star topology, particularly its vulnerability to a single point of failure. By experiencing firsthand how the failure of the central switch can disrupt network communication, learners gain a deeper understanding of the importance of redundancy and fault tolerance in network design.
